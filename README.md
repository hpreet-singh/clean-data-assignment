# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository contains peer graded assignment for the [Getting and Cleaning Data](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning/home/welcome) course. 
The assignment is to work with the [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) data set and produce a specific tidy version of it.

The assignment consists of a script [run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R) that when run produces the tidy output data. The [CodeBook.md](CodeBook.md) describes the variables and process in some more detail.

## Pre-requisites
The script needs two packages to run **dplyr** and **readr**, these should be installed first before running the script.

## Running the script
You can run the R script from RStudio or R Console. The script downloads, unzips and processes the dataset and at the end produces the file [tidy_data.csv](tidy_data.csv) as the tidy output.
